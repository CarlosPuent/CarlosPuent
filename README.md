This project aims to relate the pillars of a sales business model, such as warehouses, suppliers, stores, and products, creating reports for each pillar in PDF and XLSX formats. Additionally, it allows user management and simulates product sales through a form, generating invoices. All this information is securely stored in a relational database.
